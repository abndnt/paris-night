# Task 22: Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and Logging

## Overview

This task implemented a comprehensive error handling and logging system throughout the Flight Search SaaS application. The implementation includes structured logging, error tracking with Sentry, user-friendly error messages with recovery flows, health check endpoints for all services, and tests for error scenarios and recovery mechanisms.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Tracking with Sentry

- Improved Sentry integration with additional context and profiling
- Added fingerprinting for better error grouping
- Implemented breadcrumb tracking for request flows
- Added performance monitoring for API requests
- Created recovery information tracking for operational errors

### 2. Structured Logging System

- Enhanced Winston logger with additional context and metadata
- Added specialized logging functions for different types of events
- Implemented request ID tracking throughout the application
- Created performance logging for slow operations
- Added security event logging

### 3. User-Friendly Error Messages and Recovery Flows

- Created detailed error response format with recovery steps
- Implemented retryable flag for errors that can be retried
- Added support reference IDs for error tracking
- Created frontend components for displaying errors with recovery options
- Implemented error boundary for React components

### 4. Health Check System

- Created comprehensive health check service
- Implemented health check endpoints for all services
- Added readiness and liveness probes for Kubernetes
- Created system metrics collection for monitoring
- Implemented service-specific health checks

### 5. Request Tracking and Performance Monitoring

- Added request ID middleware for tracking requests
- Implemented performance monitoring for API requests
- Created request logging with duration tracking
- Added breadcrumb tracking for request flows
- Implemented API performance tracking

### 6. Frontend Error Handling

- Created error boundary component for React
- Implemented enhanced error message component with recovery steps
- Added error handling service for API errors
- Created error tracking integration for frontend
- Implemented retry mechanisms for recoverable errors

## Testing

- Created tests for error handling middleware
- Implemented tests for health check endpoints
- Added tests for error message components
- Created tests for request logging middleware
- Implemented tests for error recovery mechanisms
