# Security Guidelines for Flight Search SaaS

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Flight Search SaaS platform to protect user data, prevent common vulnerabilities, and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.

## Security Features

### 1. Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection

The platform implements multiple layers of rate limiting to protect against abuse and denial of service attacks:

- **Default Rate Limiting**: Limits general API requests to prevent abuse
- **Authentication Rate Limiting**: Stricter limits on authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks
- **Sensitive Operation Rate Limiting**: Very strict limits on sensitive operations like password resets
- **DDoS Protection**: Aggressive rate limiting triggered when potential DDoS attacks are detected

Implementation files:
- `src/middleware/advancedRateLimit.ts`

### 2. Input Validation and Sanitization

All user input is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks:

- **Schema Validation**: All API endpoints validate input against Joi schemas
- **XSS Prevention**: User input is sanitized to remove potentially malicious scripts
- **Content Type Validation**: Requests are validated for appropriate content types
- **Request Size Limits**: Limits on request body size to prevent abuse

Implementation files:
- `src/middleware/enhancedValidation.ts`
- `src/utils/security.ts`

### 3. Audit Logging

Comprehensive audit logging for security-relevant events:

- **Authentication Events**: Login attempts, password changes, etc.
- **Sensitive Data Access**: Tracking of who accessed what data and when
- **Administrative Actions**: Changes to system configuration and user permissions
- **GDPR-Related Events**: Data exports, deletions, and consent changes

Implementation files:
- `src/utils/auditLogger.ts`

### 4. GDPR Compliance Features

Features to ensure compliance with GDPR and other privacy regulations:

- **Data Export**: Users can request exports of all their personal data
- **Data Deletion**: Users can request deletion of their personal data
- **Consent Management**: Granular consent tracking for different data uses
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is collected and stored

Implementation files:
- `src/services/GdprService.ts`
- `src/routes/gdpr.ts`

### 5. Security Headers

HTTP security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities:

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS and data injection attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**: Enforces HTTPS
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls information in the Referer header
- **Permissions-Policy**: Limits browser features

Implementation files:
- `src/middleware/securityHeaders.ts`

## Security Best Practices

### Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with short expiration times
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with appropriate work factors
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions based on user roles
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Available for sensitive operations

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive data is encrypted in the database
- **Encryption in Transit**: All communications use HTTPS/TLS
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Credit card data and credentials are handled according to PCI-DSS guidelines
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is collected and stored

### Error Handling and Logging

- **Secure Error Handling**: Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- **Structured Logging**: Consistent log format with appropriate detail levels
- **Log Protection**: Logs are protected from unauthorized access
- **Log Retention**: Logs are retained according to compliance requirements

### Third-Party Integrations

- **API Security**: Third-party API credentials are securely stored
- **Vendor Assessment**: Third-party services are assessed for security compliance
- **Minimal Permissions**: Third-party integrations use the principle of least privilege

## Security Testing

- **Automated Security Testing**: Regular automated security tests
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular scanning for known vulnerabilities
- **Penetration Testing**: Periodic penetration testing by security professionals
- **Dependency Scanning**: Monitoring of dependencies for security issues

## Incident Response

- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring for security incidents
- **Incident Response Plan**: Documented procedures for handling security incidents
- **Breach Notification**: Process for notifying affected users in case of a breach
- **Post-Incident Analysis**: Learning from security incidents to improve security

## Compliance

- **GDPR Compliance**: Features for data subject rights and consent management
- **PCI-DSS**: Compliance with payment card industry standards
- **CCPA**: Compliance with California Consumer Privacy Act
- **SOC 2**: Security controls aligned with SOC 2 requirements
