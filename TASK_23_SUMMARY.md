  - Authentication events (login, logout, password changes)
  - Authorization events (access denied, permission changes)
  - User management events (create, update, delete)
  - Data access and export events
  - Payment and booking events
  - GDPR compliance events
  - Security events (suspicious activity, rate limiting)
- **Features**:
  - Structured logging with Winston
  - Automatic sensitive data masking
  - Severity-based categorization
  - Middleware for automatic audit logging
  - Helper functions for common audit scenarios

### 4. GDPR Compliance Features
**Files:** `src/services/GdprService.ts`, `src/routes/gdpr.ts`

- **Data Subject Rights**:
  - Data export (right to data portability)
  - Data deletion (right to be forgotten)
  - Consent management with granular controls
  - Request status tracking
- **GDPR Service Features**:
  - Comprehensive user data collection from all services
  - Secure data deletion across all systems
  - Consent validation and storage
  - Request tracking with Redis-based storage
  - Audit logging for all GDPR operations
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/gdpr/data` - Export user data
  - `DELETE /api/gdpr/data` - Delete user data
  - `GET/PUT /api/gdpr/consent` - Manage consent preferences
  - `GET /api/gdpr/request/:requestId` - Check request status

### 5. Security Headers and Middleware
**File:** `src/middleware/securityHeaders.ts`

- **Security Headers**:
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) with strict directives
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - Strict-Transport-Security with HSTS
  - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  - Permissions-Policy for browser features
- **Additional Security**:
  - HTTPS enforcement in production
  - Suspicious request detection
  - Cache control for sensitive routes
  - Cookie security attributes

### 6. Enhanced Application Security
**File:** `src/utils/app.ts` (Updated)

- **Integrated Security Stack**:
  - DDoS protection as first middleware
  - Enhanced Helmet configuration
  - Reduced request size limits (1MB from 10MB)
  - Enhanced CORS configuration
  - Raw body preservation for webhook signature verification
  - Comprehensive security header application

### 7. Security Testing Suite
**Files:** `src/tests/security.test.ts`, `src/tests/vulnerabilityAssessment.test.ts`

- **Security Tests**:
  - Security headers validation
  - Rate limiting functionality
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Password security (hashing and verification)
  - GDPR compliance endpoints
  - Suspicious request detection
- **Vulnerability Assessment**:
  - SQL injection prevention
  - XSS protection
  - CSRF protection
  - Secure headers validation
  - Sensitive data exposure prevention
  - Authentication security
  - Security misconfiguration checks
  - Access control validation
  - Insecure deserialization protection

### 8. Security Documentation
**File:** `docs/security-guidelines.md`

- **Comprehensive Security Guide**:
  - Detailed feature documentation
  - Security best practices
  - Compliance information (GDPR, PCI-DSS, CCPA, SOC 2)
  - Incident response procedures
  - Security contact information
  - Regular update schedule

## Technical Implementation Details

### Security Architecture
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Zero Trust**: Validate and sanitize all inputs
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions and access
- **Fail Secure**: Secure defaults and error handling

### Performance Considerations
- **Redis-backed Rate Limiting**: Distributed and scalable
- **Efficient Validation**: Schema-based validation with caching
- **Minimal Overhead**: Optimized middleware ordering
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation if Redis is unavailable

### Monitoring and Alerting
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All security events logged
- **Error Tracking**: Integration with Sentry for security incidents
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit log for compliance
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Security events tracked in real-time

## Security Compliance

### GDPR Compliance
- ✅ Right to data portability (data export)
- ✅ Right to be forgotten (data deletion)
- ✅ Consent management
- ✅ Data minimization
- ✅ Audit logging for all data operations

### Security Standards
- ✅ OWASP Top 10 protection
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Secure authentication and session management
- ✅ Access control and authorization
- ✅ Security logging and monitoring
