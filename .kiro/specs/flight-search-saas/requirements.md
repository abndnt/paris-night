# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Flight Search SaaS is an intelligent travel booking platform that simplifies the complex process of finding and booking flights using credit card reward points and airline loyalty programs. The platform combines AI-powered route optimization with an intuitive, chat-like interface powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to make points-based travel accessible to both novice and experienced travelers.
